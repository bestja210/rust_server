# rust_server

Multithreaded webserver using Rust. Final Project in the Rust Programming Language Book.

# Introduction

This project was used as a means to bring together the topics covered in the online book titled The Rust Programming Language. The project demonstrates asynchronous programming in Rust to produce a multithreaded webserver. It also encompases other powerful features of the Rust programming language such as type aliasing, asynchronous code that reads as though its synchronous, and pattern matching to name a few.
